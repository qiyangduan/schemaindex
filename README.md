2. Search for all tables/entities in those data sources by their names.

# Installation

Installation
============

On Linux
-------------
(tested 20171222)
A universal installation method (that works on Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, â€¦,
and always provides the latest version) is to use `pip`_:


.. code-block:: bash

    # Make sure we have an up-to-date version of pip and setuptools:
n    $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

    $ pip install --upgrade httpie


(If ``pip`` installation fails for some reason, you can try
``easy_install httpie`` as a fallback.)
